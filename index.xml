To ensure victory for the Pandavas, he offers to sacrifice his life. In return, he asks for three boons. He wants to die a hero‚Äôs death during battle; he wants to watch the entire battle, even after death; and he wants to experience marital bliss. The first two boons are easy to grant: he will be honourably beheaded and his severed head will oversee the war.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/moc/HS5930-War-and-Peace-in-West-Asia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/moc/HS5930-War-and-Peace-in-West-Asia/</guid><description>[[World]] [[West Asia]]

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you&amp;rsquo;d like to get.
The majority of configuration can be be found under data/config.yaml. An annotated example configuration is shown below.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! You can head to &amp;lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/quartz to see it live.
Enable GitHub Actions By default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the &amp;lsquo;Actions&amp;rsquo; tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!

Obsidian I strongly recommend using Obsidian as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of my local files.
üîó How to link your Obsidian Vault
Of course, all the files are in Markdown so you could just use your favourite text editor of choice.</description></item><item><title>External Hosting</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/external-hosting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/external-hosting/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ignoring Notes</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/ignore-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/ignore-notes/</guid><description>Quartz Ignore Edit ignoreFiles in config.toml to include paths you&amp;rsquo;d like to exclude from being rendered.

More details in Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation .
Global Ignore However, just adding to the ignoreFiles will only prevent the page from being access through Quartz.</description></item><item><title>Obsidian Vault Integration</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/obsidian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/obsidian/</guid><description>Setup Obsidian is the preferred way to use Quartz. You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.
New Vault If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an existing Vault, download Obsidian and create a new Vault in the /content folder that you created and cloned during the setup .
Linking an existing Vault The easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of our files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the /content folder.</description></item><item><title>Preview Changes</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/preview-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/preview-changes/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, here&amp;rsquo;s exactly how to do that!

If you are unfamiliar, this resource is a great place to start!
Forking A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
Navigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:

Yes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on excluding pages from being published .
Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages? Yes! All built files can be found under /public in the master branch. More details under hosting .
Do I need a website already? No! Setting up Quartz means you set up a site too :)</description></item></channel></rss>
