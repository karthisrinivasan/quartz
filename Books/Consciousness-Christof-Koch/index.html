The term was coined by the philosopher David Chalmers.</p><p>Man must at last wake up out of his millenary dream and discover his total solitude, his fundamental isolation. He must realize that, like a gypsy, he lives on the boundary of an alien world; a world that is deaf to his music, and as indifferent to his hopes as it is to his sufferings and his crimes.</p><hr><p>Chapter 2:</p><p>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;<br>Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,<br>But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.<br>So eager did I render my companions,<br>With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,<br>That then I hardly could have held them back.
And having turned our stern unto the morning,<br>We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,
Evermore gaining on the larboard side.<br>—Dante Alighieri, Inferno (1531)</p><hr><p>Chapter 3:</p><p>How did evolution convert the water of biological tissue into the wine of consciousness?<br>—Colin McGinn, The Mysterious Flame (1999)</p><p>Molecular engineers, under the leadership of the scientist–entrepreneur Craig Venter, achieved a milestone in 2010 with the creation of a new species. They sequenced the genome (a single stretch of DNA one million letters long) of a bacterium, added identifying watermarks to it, synthesized the genes that made up the genome (using the four types of chemicals that make up DNA), and assembled them into one string that was then implanted into the cell body of a donor bacterium whose own DNA had been removed. The artificial genome successfully commanded the donor cell’s protein-making machinery, and the new organism, dubbed Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0, proceeded to replicate generation after generation. Although the creation of a new bacterial species does not make a golem, it is nevertheless an amazing act, a watershed moment in history.</p><p>John Tyndall, the Irish-born physicist who discovered why the sky is blue and that water vapor and carbon dioxide are the two biggest heat-trapping greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere, well articulated the difficulty of linking consciousness to the brain as far back as 1868:<br>The passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is unthinkable as a result of mechanics. Granted that a definite thought, and a definite molecular action in the brain, occur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual organ, nor apparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us to pass, by a process of reasoning, from the one phenomenon to the other. They appear together, but we do not know why. Were our minds and senses so expanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all their motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges, if such there be; and were we intimately acquainted with the corresponding states of thought and feeling, we should be as far as ever from the solution of the problem, “How are these physical processes connected with the facts of consciousness?” The chasm between the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually impassable. Let the consciousness for love, for example, be associated with a right-handed spiral motion of the molecules of the brain, and the consciousness of hate with a left-handed spiral motion. We should then know, when we love, that the motion is in one direction, and, when we hate, that the motion is in the other; but the “WHY?” would remain as unanswerable as before.<br>This challenge is what Chalmers refers to as the Hard Problem.</p><p>Optogenetics: This method targets specific groups of nerve cells deep inside an animal’s brain that have been infected with modified viruses. The viruses cause the neurons to sprout photoreceptors that respond only to light of a specific wavelength. The neurons can then be turned on with brief pulses of blue light and turned off with equally brief pulses of yellow light.</p><p>Leibniz wrote in 1714:<br>Moreover, we must confess that the perception, and what depends on it, is inexplicable in terms of mechanical reasons, that is, through shapes and motions. If we imagine that there is a machine whose structure makes it think, sense, and have perceptions, we could conceive it enlarged, keeping the same proportions, so that one could enter into it, as one enters into a mill. Assuming that, when inspecting its interior, we will only find parts that push one another, and we will never find anything to explain a perception.</p><p>They denigrate reason and those who serve its call, for a complete elucidation of consciousness threatens long and dearly held beliefs about the soul, about human exceptionalism, about the primacy of the organic over the inorganic. Dostoyevsky’s Grand Inquisitor understands this mind-set well: “There are three powers, three powers alone that are able to conquer and hold captive for ever the conscience of these impotent rebels for their happiness—those forces are miracle, mystery, and authority.”</p><p>Qualia is the plural of quale. What it feels like to have a particular experience is the quale of that experience: The quale of the color red is what is common to such disparate percepts as seeing a red sunset, the red flag of China, arterial blood, a ruby gemstone, and Homer’s wine-dark sea. The common denominator of all these subjective states is “redness.” Qualia are the raw feelings, the elements that make up any one conscious experience.</p><p>I believe that qualia are properties of the natural world. They do not have a divine or supernatural origin. Rather, they are the consequences of unknown laws that I would like to uncover.</p><p>What Is the Function of Consciousness?<br>Another persistent puzzle is why we have any experiences at all. Could we not live, beget, and raise children without consciousness? Such a zombie existence does not contradict any known natural law.</p><p>Defining what, exactly, constitutes jazz is notoriously difficult. Hence the saying, “Man, if you gotta ask, you’re never gonna know.” The same holds true for consciousness. It isn’t possible to explain conscious feelings without invoking other feelings, qualia, or states of sentience. This difficulty is reflected in the many circular definitions of consciousness. The Oxford English Dictionary, for instance, defines consciousness as “the state of being conscious, regarded as the normal condition of healthy waking life.”</p><p>Premature rigor can act as a Procrustean bed, constraining progress.</p><p>The thalamus is a quail egg–sized structure in the middle of the brain that regulates all input into the neocortex and receives massive feedback from it. Pretty much every region of the cerebral cortex receives input from a specific region of the thalamus and sends information back to it.</p><p>Neither at the genomic nor at the synaptic, cellular, or connectional levels are there qualitative differences between mice, monkeys, and people.</p><hr><p>Chapter 4:</p><p>In the early 1990s, Francis Crick and I focused on what we called the neural (or neuronal) correlates of consciousness (NCC). We defined them as the minimal neural mechanisms jointly sufficient for any one specific conscious percept.</p><p>Imagine that you are looking at a red cube, mysteriously left in the desert sand, with a butterfly fluttering above it. Your mind apprehends the cube in a flash. It performs this feat because the brain activates specialized cortical neurons that represent color and combines them with neurons that encode the percept of depth, as well as neurons that encode the orientation of the various lines that make up the cube. The minimal set of such neurons that causes the conscious percept is the neural correlate of consciousness for perceiving this alien object.</p><p>functional MRI (fMRI) relies on a fortuitous property of the blood supply to reveal regional brain activity. Active synapses and neurons consume power and therefore need more oxygen, which is delivered by the hemoglobin molecules inside the circulating red blood cells. When these molecules give off their oxygen to the surrounding tissue, they not only change color—from arterial red to venous blue—but also turn slightly magnetic. Activity in neural tissue causes an increase in the volume and flow of fresh blood. This change in the blood supply, called the hemodynamic signal, is tracked by sending radio waves into the skull and carefully listening to their return echoes. Keep in mind that fMRI does not directly measure synaptic and neuronal activity, which occurs over the course of milliseconds. Instead, it uses a relatively sluggish proxy—changes in the blood supply—that rises and falls in seconds. The spatial resolution of fMRI is limited to a volume element (voxel) the size of a pea, encompassing about one million nerve cells.</p><p>In 1995, Francis and I published a manuscript in the international journal Nature with the title, “Are we aware of neural activity in primary visual cortex?”</p><p>Recently, clinicians recorded the EEG of two classes of severely brain-injured patients, those that remain unconscious and those that recover at least some measure of awareness. They found that the critical difference is the presence or absence of communication between prefrontal regions and temporal, sensory cortical regions in the back. If such feedback is present, consciousness is preserved. If not, it is absent. This is a rather gratifying development.</p><hr><p>Chapter 5:</p><p>Akinetopsia is a rare and devastating motion blindness. The individual with this disorder is banished to a world lit only by strobe lights, like a disco or nightclub. The dancers are clearly illuminated by each flash, but they appear frozen, devoid of motion. Seeing yourself move in this fashion in a mirror is mesmerizing, but I can assure you that the excitement wears off quickly. The motion-blind patient infers that objects have moved by comparing their relative positions in time, but she does not see them move. She can see a car change position, but cannot see it drive toward her. Other aspects of vision, including color, form, and the ability to detect flickering lights, are intact.</p><p>Furthermore, only one hemisphere, typically the left one, speaks. That is, if the right hemisphere is lost or silenced by anesthesia, the patient can still talk, which is why the left is called the dominant hemisphere. The right hemisphere by itself has only limited language comprehension and is mute, though it can grunt and sing. So, when engaged in conversation with a split-brain patient, it is the person’s left hemisphere that is doing all the talking.</p><p>In summary, local properties of the cortex and its satellite structures mediate the specific content of consciousness, whereas global properties are critical for sustaining consciousness per se. For a coherent coalition of neurons to assemble at all—and for awareness to emerge—the cortico-thalamic complex needs to be suffused with neurotransmitters, chemicals released by the long and winding tentacles of neurons in the deeper and older parts of the brain. Both local and global aspects are critical for consciousness.</p><hr><p>Chapter 6:</p><p>Francis Crick and I called these unconscious mechanisms zombie agents. Collectively, this zombie army manages the fluid and rapid interplay of muscles and nerves that is at the heart of all skills and that makes up a lived life.</p><p>Zombie behaviors can be thought of as more flexible and adaptive reflexes that involve the forebrain.</p><p>Constant repetition recruits an army of zombie agents that makes the skill effortless, the motion of your body fast, without wasted effort. You never give a thought to the minutiae of your actions, yet they require split-second coordination and a marvelous merging of muscle and nerve.<br>The shift from attention-demanding and awareness-hogging action to automatic and unconscious action is accomplished by a shift of neuronal resources from the prefrontal cortex to the basal ganglia and cerebellum.</p><p>William James, the father of American psychology and brother of the novelist Henry James, held that the act of thinking about or observing a behavior increases the tendency to engage in that behavior. This principle of ideomotor action is a natural consequence of the partial overlap of the representations of perception and action in the cerebral cortex. The discovery of so-called mirror neurons in the brain of monkeys confirms the notion that perception of an action is closely allied to carrying out that action.</p><p>If you don’t believe me, just take an implicit association test (I recommend the Harvard one, which you can find online), in which you answer a bunch of questions as quickly as you can. The test measures, in an indirect, oblique manner that is resistant to manipulation or lying, the extent of your bias for or against a particular religion, gender, sexual orientation, or ethnic group.</p><p>To underscore this, let me tell you about choice blindness. More than one hundred students at the University of Lund in Sweden had to compare two head shots of young women. The experimentalist held each photo in his hand, side by side, and the students had to decide within a few seconds which looked more attractive and point to her. The photos were then briefly removed from sight. Immediately afterward, the students were shown the face they found prettier again and were asked to explain their choice. In some trials, the experimentalist exchanged the pictures using a sleight-of-hand before asking the student to explain his or her choice. Even though the women depicted in the two photos were quite different, most people were fooled. Only one in four students realized that the photos had been switched and that the one they were looking at was not the one they had just picked (in these cases, the experiment was immediately broken off). The other students blithely justified their “choice,” even though it contradicted what they had decided only a few seconds earlier: “She’s radiant. I would rather have approached her at a bar than the other one. I like earrings,” even though the woman they had selected looked solemn and had no earrings.</p><p>First, it raises the concern that I may be putting the cart before the horse. If the domain of the submental, the nonconscious, is so all-encompassing, most of the brain and its activity may not relate to consciousness at all.</p><p>Second, zombie agents make life more difficult for consciousness researchers because they force us to separate behavior from consciousness: purposeful, routine, rapid actions do not by themselves imply sentience.</p><p>Third, the widespread existence of zombie routines throws the question of neural correlates of consciousness into bold relief.</p><hr><p>Chapter 7:</p><p>Biophysicists, the specialists who study the structure of cells at the level of proteins and bilipid membranes, by and large see no evidence that quantum fluctuations play a critical role in the life of a neuron. Nervous systems, like anything else, obey the laws of quantum mechanics; yet the collective effect of all these molecules frenetically moving about is to smooth out any quantum indeterminacy, an effect called decoherence.</p><p>Intuitively, the sequence of events that leads to a voluntary act must be as follows: You decide to raise your hand; your brain communicates that intention to the neurons responsible for planning and executing hand movements (the faint echo of their electrical activity is the readiness potential); and those neurons relay the appropriate commands to the motor neurons in the spinal cord that contract the arm muscles. The mind chooses and the brain acts. This makes a great deal of sense when I introspect. My mind decides to go for a run, my brain gives the appropriate commands, and I look for my sneakers. But Libet wasn’t convinced. Wasn’t it more likely that the mind and the brain acted simultaneously, or even that the brain acted before the mind did?<br>Libet set out to determine the timing of a mental event, a person’s deliberate decision, and compare that to the timing of a physical event, the onset of the readiness potential. What a relief—after millennia of wearisome philosophical debates, finally a question that can be settled one way or the other. The tricky part of the experiment was determining the exact moment when the mental act occurred. I challenge you to infer the exact moment when you first feel the urge to raise your hand; it’s not easy.<br>To help his subjects, Libet projected a point of bright light onto an old-fashioned green oscilloscope screen. The light went around and around, like the tip of the minute hand on a clock. Sitting in a chair with EEG electrodes on his or her head, each volunteer had to spontaneously, but deliberately, flex their wrist. They did this while noting the position of the light when they became aware of the wish or urge to act. To assure himself that the volunteers’ subjective timing of nervous events was accurate, Libet had them note in a separate experiment when their wrist actually started to bend, a point in time that could be objectively confirmed by recording their muscle activity. The subjects could do this quite well, predating the actual onset by a mere eighty milliseconds.<br>The results told an unambiguous story. The beginning of the readiness potential precedes the conscious decision to move by at least half a second, and often by much longer. The brain acts before the mind decides! This was a complete reversal of the deeply held intuition of mental causation—the brain and the body act only after the mind has willed it. That is why this experiment was, and remains, controversial. But it has been repeated and refined over the intervening years—a brain-imaging version of the experiment was in the news recently—and its basic conclusion stands.</p><p>This is a neglected idea in the free will debate—that the mind–body nexus creates a specific, conscious sensation of voluntary movement, a compelling experience of “I willed this,” or “I am the author of this action.” Like other subjective experiences, this feeling of willing has specific phenomenal content. It has a quale no different in kind from the quale of tasting bitter almond.</p><hr><p>Chapter 8:</p><p>Subjectivity is too radically different from anything physical for it to be an emergent phenomenon.</p><p>Monadology:<br>1. The MONAD, which we shall discuss here, is nothing but a simple substance that enters into composites—simple, that is, without parts.<br>2. And there must be simple substances, since there are composites; for the composite is nothing more than a collection, or aggregate, of simples.</p><p>I believe that consciousness is a fundamental, an elementary, property of living matter. It can’t be derived from anything else; it is a simple substance, in Leibniz’s words.</p><p>Consciousness comes with organized chunks of matter. It is immanent in the organization of the system. It is a property of complex entities and cannot be further reduced to the action of more elementary properties. We’ve arrived at the ground floor of reductionism (that is why the reductionist of the subtitle of this book is tempered by the romantic).</p><p>Consciousness is substrate-independent</p><p>A basic requirement of any scientific theory is that it must deal with measurable things. Galileo expressed it as “Measure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so.” A theory of consciousness must quantify consciousness, linking specific facets of neuroanatomy and physiology to qualia, and explain why consciousness wanes during anesthesia and sleep.</p><p>Conscious states share a second property; they are highly integrated. Any conscious state is a monad, a unit—it cannot be subdivided into components that are experienced independently. No matter how hard you try, you can’t see the world in black and white; nor can you see only the left (or right) half of your field of view (without closing one eye or some such shenanigan).</p><p>Whatever information I am conscious of is wholly and completely present to my mind. Underlying this unity of consciousness is a multitude of causal interactions among the relevant parts of my brain. If areas of the brain become fragmented, disconnected, and balkanized, as occurs under anesthesia, consciousness fades. Conversely, when many regions are activated in synchrony—revealed in the conjoint rising and falling of the EEG signal, as in deep sleep—integration is high, but there is little specific information being conveyed.</p><p>He posits that the quantity of conscious experience generated by any physical system in a particular state is equal to the amount of integrated information generated by the system in that state above and beyond the information generated by its parts.</p><p>The system must discriminate among a large repertoire of states (differentiation), and it must do so as part of a unified whole, one that can’t be decomposed into a collection of causally independent parts (integration).</p><p>Integrated information theory introduces a precise measure capturing the extent of consciousness called Φ, or phi (and pronounced “fi”). Expressed in bits, Φ quantifies the reduction of uncertainty that occurs in a system, above and beyond the information generated independently by its parts, when that system enters a particular state.</p><p>Integrated information theory makes a number of predictions. One of the more counterintuitive, and therefore powerful, ones is that integrated information arises from causal interactions within the system. When those interactions can’t take place anymore, even though the actual state of the system remains unchanged, Φ shrinks.</p><p>The fact that neurons could fire but do not is meaningful and quite different from the situation in which neurons can’t fire because they have been artificially silenced.</p><p>Computing Φ is rather demanding because all possible ways the system can be divided have to be considered—that is, every way to cut the network into two parts, all ways to cut it into three parts, and so on until one arrives at the atomic partition, where all units that make up the network are considered in isolation. In combinatorial mathematics, the number of all such partitions is Bell’s number. It is large. For the 302 neurons that make up the nervous system of C. elegans, the number of ways that this network can be cut into parts is the hyperastronomical 10 followed by 467 zeros. Computing Φ for any nervous system, therefore, is fiendishly difficult and requires heuristics, shortcuts, and approximations.</p><p>Computer simulations of small networks show that achieving high Φ values is difficult. Typically, such circuits possess only a couple of bits of integrated information. High Φ networks require both specialization and integration, a hallmark of neural circuitry in the cortico-thalamic complex. Φ denotes the size of the conscious repertoire associated with any network of causally interacting parts. The more integrated and differentiated the system is, the more conscious it is.</p><p>Synchronous firing of action potentials among neurons is another means of integration. Mind you, if all of the brain’s neurons were to fire in a synchronized manner, as in a grand mal epileptic seizure, integration would be maximal, but differentiation would be minimal. Maximizing Φ is about finding the sweet spot between these two opposing tendencies.</p><p>In terms of neural connections, the dominant trait of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex is their abundance of local, excitatory connections, supplemented with fewer connections to faraway neurons. Networks made of such components are known in mathematics as small-world graphs. Any two units in these networks, any two cortical neurons, are no more than a few synapses away. This property would tend to maximize Φ.<br>Conversely, Φ is low for networks composed of numerous small, quasi-independent modules. This may explain why the cerebellum, despite its huge number of neurons, does not contribute much to consciousness: Its crystalline-like synaptic organization is such that its modules act independently of one another, with little interaction between distant ones.</p><p>That is, the way in which integrated information is generated determines not only how much consciousness a system has, but also what kind of consciousness it has. Giulio’s theory does this by introducing the notion of qualia space, whose dimensionality is identical to the number of different states the system can occupy. For a simple network with n binary switching elements, qualia space has 2n dimensions, one for each possible state. Each axis denotes the probability that the system is in that one state.<br>The state of any physical system can be mapped onto a shape in this fantastically multidimensional qualia space. Its surfaces are</p><p>facets. The technical term for this shape is polytope, but I prefer the more poetic crystal.</p><p>The crystal is the system viewed from within. It is the voice in the head, the light inside the skull. It is everything you will ever know of the world. It is your only reality. It is the quiddity of experience.</p><p>The theory can be used to build a consciousness-meter. This gadget takes the wiring diagram of any system of interacting components, be it wet biological circuits or those etched in silicon, to assesses the size of that system’s conscious repertoire. The consciousness-meter scans the network’s physical circuitry, reading out its activity level to compute Φ and the crystal shape of the qualia the network is momentarily experiencing. A geometrical calculus will need to be developed to determine whether the crystal has the morphology of a painfully stubbed toe or of the scent of a rose under a full moon.</p><p>Any system whose functional connectivity and architecture yield a Φ value greater than zero has at least a trifle of experience.</p><p>the noosphere, the interactions of myriads of human minds that are manifest in contemporary urban societies:</p><p>A glow ripples outward from the first spark of conscious reflection. The point of ignition grows larger. The fire spreads in ever widening circles till finally the whole planet is covered with incandescence. It is really a new layer, the thinking layer, which . . . has spread over and above the world of plants and animals. In other words, outside and above the biosphere there is the noosphere.</p><hr><p>Chapter 9:</p><p>Is consciousness a fundamental, irreducible aspect of reality? Or does it emerge from organized matter, as most scientists and philosophers believe? I want to know before I die; so I can’t afford to wait forever.</p><p>photoreceptors in single-cell green algae. These photoreceptors directly (rather than indirectly, like the ones in your eyes) convert incoming blue light into an excitatory, positive electrical signal. The trio isolated the gene for this protein, a light-gated ion channel that spans the neuronal membrane called channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Bamberg and Nagel subsequently engaged in a fruitful collaboration with Karl Deisseroth, a psychiatrist and neurobiologist from Stanford University, and Ed Boyden, a neuroengineer now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br>The group took the ChR2 gene, inserted it into a small virus, and infected neurons with this virus. Many of the neurons took up the foreign instructions, synthesized the ChR2 protein, and incorporated the out-of-place photoreceptors into their membrane. In the dark, the receptors quietly sit there, with no discernible effect on their host cells. But illumination with a brief flash of blue light causes each of these bacterial photoreceptors to jolt their host cell a bit. Their collective action generates an action potential. Each time the light is turned on, the cell spikes reliably, exactly once. Thus, the neuron can be driven to fire spikes by precisely timed stabs of blue light.</p><p>The biophysicists added another naturally occurring light-sensitive protein to their tool kit. It derives from ancient bacteria living in dry salt lakes in the Sahara. Shining yellow light onto it yields an inhibitory, negative signal.</p><p>When neural activity travels from higher-order visual cortex down to lower regions or from the front of the brain to the back, the integrated information represented by this coalition of neurons will surge, giving rise to a conscious sensation or thought.<br>Such hypotheses can now be tested in appropriately engineered mice: Train them in any one visual discrimination behavior and then transiently turn off the wires that feed back from higher cortical regions to lower ones. If Francis and I are right, innate, stereotyped, or highly rehearsed visuo-motor behaviors will only be minimally affected. But complex behaviors that depend on murine consciousness will fail. Testing our hypothesis requires that mice can be trained to respond to optical bistable illusions, to distinguish a figure from its background, or to learn to associate visual landmarks with a tasty morsel of food. If cortico-cortical feedback is turned off throughout the brain, we will have created true zombie mice, incapable of phenomenal experience! If the feedback is reactivated, conscious sensations return.</p><hr><p>Chapter 10:</p><p>Think of this crystal as the twenty-first-century version of the soul. But, hélas, it is not immortal. Once the underlying physical system disintegrates, the crystal is extinguished. It returns to the unformed void, where it was before the system was constituted.</p><p>Francis’s opposition to organized religion became legendary when he resigned from Churchill College at Cambridge University in 1961 to protest plans to add a chapel to the college grounds. Francis was of the opinion that religion had no place in a modern college with an emphasis on science, mathematics, and engineering. Sir Winston Churchill—in whose name the college had been founded—tried to appease him by pointing out that the money for the construction of the chapel was being raised privately and that nobody would be forced to attend services there. Francis replied by proposing a fund for the construction of a brothel associated with the college: nobody would be forced to take advantage of its services, and it would accept men no matter what their religious beliefs. Included in his letter was a down payment of ten guineas. Understandably, this put an end to any further correspondence between the two men.</p><p>I’m optimistic that science is poised fully to comprehend the mind–body problem.
