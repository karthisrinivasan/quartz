- The effective temperature of the Earth when seen from outer space is hotter, not cooler, than Venus.
*****

I think the zone of habitability idea is flawed because it ignores the possibility that a planet bearing life will tend to modify its environment and climate in a way that favours the life upon it, as ours does.
*****

A main sequence star like our Sun gradually heats the planet Daisyworld until it is just warm enough for a species of black daisies to colonize the entire surface. Black daisies absorb heat so they thrive in these low temperatures. But there are mutant white daisies which reflect heat and, as the temperature rises even further, these begin to flourish. So Daisyworld is cooled by white daisies and warmed by black ones. A simple flower is able to regulate and stabilize the environment on a planetary scale. Moreover, this stabilization emerges from a strictly Darwinian process.
Scale up this model to include all the flora and fauna of Earth and you have the system I have called Gaia.

All Newcomen did was build a steam-powered pump. It burned coal and used the heat produced to boil water into steam which was let into a cylinder with a movable piston. The piston rose and then cold water from a stream nearby was sprayed into the cylinder; the steam condensed, the pressure dropped and the piston moved back to its starting position, doing a substantial amount of work in the process and clearing the mines of water. This ‘atmospheric steam engine’ was not the first steam engine, but it was the best so far and its descendants powered the railway engines of the nineteenth century. For my purposes, what it was used for is of less significance than its impact.
This little engine did nothing less than unleash the Industrial Revolution.
*****

The important feature of Newcomen's engine was its profitability. The mere idea of the engine would not have been enough to ensure its development. Its great significance – for good or ill – was because it was cheaper as a source of work than human or horse power.
*****

the key point that justifies the definition of the Anthropocene as a new geological period is the radical change that took place when humans first began to convert stored solar energy into useful work.
*****

This makes the Anthropocene the second stage in the planet's processing of the power of the Sun. In the first stage the chemical process of photosynthesis enabled organisms to convert light into chemical energy. The third stage will be the Novacene, when solar energy is converted into information.

The Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White
*****

Wordsworth saw more clearly and painfully than most what was happening. His sonnet ‘On the Projected Kendal and Windermere Railway’ begins:
Is then no nook of English ground secure
From rash assault? Schemes of retirement sown
In youth, and 'mid the busy world kept pure
As when their earliest flowers of hope were blown,
Must perish;– how can they this blight endure?
*****

Lewis Mumford noted in Technics and Civilization, ‘War is the supreme drama of a completely mechanized society.’

terrible climax in 1961 with the Soviet Tsar Bomba, a 50-megaton fusion weapon which, if ever used in anger, would obliterate a large city and its immediate surroundings. The pollution from these tests was so huge that even today, nearly sixty years later, the resulting radioactivity of our bodies is useful to forensic scientists in establishing times of death.

Bees’ nests are different from termites’ nests – they are more hierarchical. Newly hatched bees appear to be given menial tasks: for example, a bee might sit at the entrance to the nest and use its wings to fan a constant flow of air as part of the nest's programme to sustain the most habitable temperature for its occupants. Young bees also take on the comparatively easy task of feeding and tending the larvae. As they grow older they take on more skilled tasks, such as defence and repairs to breaches in the walls. Then, with their education near complete, they are taught the rudiments of foraging – the skilled task of finding nearby sources of food, assessing its quantity and worth, then flying back to the nest to tell their sisters the news. Finally, the wisest foragers may be chosen for the most challenging task, that of finding a suitable site for the next nest. It could be anywhere within a 2-kilometre radius.

Similarly, when young, Earth and Gaia could withstand shocks like super-volcanic eruptions or asteroid strikes; when old, any one of these could sterilize the entire planet. A warm Earth would be a more vulnerable Earth.
*****

It took Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer and inventor, to observe how wrong it was to call this planet Earth when, clearly, it is Ocean.
*****

So 47°C sets the limit for any kind of life on an ocean planet like the Earth. Once this temperature is passed, even silicon-based intelligence would face an impossible environment. It is even possible that the floor of the ocean would enter the supercritical state and in places where the magma emerged there would be no separation between rocks and supercritical-state steam.

‘For the victims inclined to protest against the system,’ writes Clive Hamilton, an Australian professor of Public Ethics, in ‘The Theodicy of the “Good Anthropocene” ’ (2016), ‘the golden promise of a new dawn lulls them into silent endurance. The message of the good Anthropocene to those suffering now and in the future from human-induced droughts, floods and heatwaves is: you are suffering for the greater good; we will help to alleviate it if we can but your pain is justified.’

‘If a lion could talk,’ said the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, ‘we could not understand him.’ This was a more rigorous version of Čapek's remark on humans and dogs. Wittgenstein's point was that our language is our way of life and it is how we see the world. Lions would not share any of those perspectives. And neither would the cyborgs.

To make sure that they are safe and proof against component failure, the autopilots include three independent systems and, unless there is agreement among this triumvirate, the handling of the plane is passed back to the pilots, who are also there on board.

At its best, human hearing can detect a sound with an amplitude equal to a tenth of the diameter of a proton.

Human sight is so sensitive that if it were only slightly more sensitive we would see a set of flashes in the night sky as individual quanta of light illuminating our retinas.
