That our brain outranks that of other animals not because we are an exception in evolution, but rather because, for simple evolutionary reasons, we hold the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex, affordable to no other species.  
  
*****  
  
In terms of anatomy, our brain matter seemed to be made not very differently from that of other animals.  
  
*****  
  
In our first analysis,3 which did not include the human brain, we found that brain mass in primates scales (increases) with the number of neurons in the brain raised to the power of +1.0—that is, the primate brain scales in an essentially linear manner as it gains neurons across species.  
  
*****  
  
brain mass scales much faster as rodent brains gain neurons,4 as a power law with allometric exponent +1.6.  
  
*****  
  
the “primate advantage”:7 because of the way a primate brain is put together, a much larger number of neurons fits into a cerebral cortex of similar size to that of a rodent—which is a major asset when volume is at a premium  
  
*****  
  
This means that, as the primate cortex evolved, it started to gain neurons without a significant systematic increase in the average size of its neurons. This does not mean that primate neurons became smaller, but only that they stopped growing: the primate cortex seems to have retained an average neuronal cell size similar to that in the rat or rabbit cortex, and definitely smaller than that in the agouti cortex.  
  
*****  
  
The conclusion should come as no surprise to a biologist: we are that generic primate with 86 billion neurons in its brain. Our brain is made in the image of other primate brains.  
  
*****  
  
Lo and behold, the African elephant brain had more neurons than the human brain.16 And not just a few more: a full  three times the number of neurons, 257 billion to our 86 billion neurons. But—and this was a huge, immense “but”—a whopping 98 percent of those neurons were located in the cerebellum, at the back of the brain. In every other mammal we had examined so far, the cerebellum concentrated most of the brain neurons, but never much more than 80 percent of them. The exceptional distribution of neurons within the elephant brain left a relatively meager 5.6 billion neurons in the whole cerebral cortex itself (in both hemispheres: all numbers obtained for the right hemisphere were doubled to yield whole-brain numbers comparable to other species). Despite the size of the African elephant cerebral cortex (an impressive 2.8 kilograms, or over 6 pounds), the 5.6 billion neurons in it paled in comparison to the average 16 billion neurons concentrated in the much smaller human cerebral cortex (1.2 kilograms or 2.6 pounds), and even in comparison to the 9 billion neurons we estimated in the cerebral cortex of the gorilla and the orangutan.17 Interestingly, the cerebral cortex of the elephant had just the mass expected for its number of neurons, compared both to other afrotherians like itself and to rodents, eulipotyphlans, and artiodactyls.  
  
*****  
  
The African elephant cerebellum, on the other hand, was special in not one, but two ways. First, it had over ten times as many neurons as a generic mammalian cerebellum could be expected to have given the number of neurons in the accompanying cerebral cortex. The average ratio for mammals is 4.2 neurons in the cerebellum to every neuron in the cortex, and that ratio in the elephant was 44.8. Second, that excessive number of neurons in the elephant cerebellum did not fit the neuronal scaling rules for afrotherian and nonprimate, noneulipotyphlan mammals  
  
*****  
  
The superior cognitive capabilities of the human brain over the elephant brain can simply—and only—be attributed to the remarkably large number of neurons in its cerebral cortex.  
  
*****  
  
The human advantage, I would say, lies in having the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex that any animal species has ever managed  
  
*****  
  
The cognitive superiority of human brains could no longer be attributed to a relatively enlarged frontal cortex.  
  
*****  
  
Furthermore, if the same competition mechanism operates at both developmental and evolutionary levels, matching numbers of motor neurons to muscle mass, then it is not so much that a larger body  requires a larger number of motor neurons to control but, rather, that it allows a larger number of neurons to survive.  
  
*****  
  
A new picture thus emerges, one in which the central nervous system is formed first, with numbers of neurons that are determined genetically and proportional to the length of the body, but that can be further reduced depending on the actual mass of muscles and sensory targets available for innervation.  
  
*****  
  
This difference, by the way, indicates that even though the average size of neurons in the rest of brain is related to body mass, the number of neurons in the rest of brain is not.  
  
*****  
  
As it turns out, then, the human brain is not special in its number of neurons: we have just as many neurons as expected in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and rest of brain for a non–great ape primate of our body and brain mass.  
  
*****  
  
Give me the size of a mammalian brain structure—any structure in any species—and I can predict, with good accuracy, how many glial cells it will have.  
  
*****  
  
human brain, with just over 1,200 times as many neurons as a mouse brain, costs just over 1,200 times as much glucose as a mouse brain: 497.9 micromoles per minute. Over a full day, the 71 million neurons in a mouse brain cost 0.11 grams of glucose, or just 0.4 kilocalorie per day  
  
*****  
  
So the human brain is not special in the absolute energy cost of its neurons (it costs just as much as expected for its number of neurons), nor in the relative cost of its cerebral cortex (which holds a similar proportion of all brain neurons as in other species, elephant excluded). Why, then, is the human brain's relative energy cost so high, reaching 25 percent of the energy used by the entire body, whereas in other species it amounts to 10 percent at most?  
  
*****  
  
It is relatively expensive compared to the body simply because it is a primate brain, and, as such, it holds a large number of neurons for its body compared to nonprimates.  
  
*****  
  
Heavy lifting requires more energy, but heavy thinking, surprisingly, consumes no more energy as a whole than, say, mental idling. To be sure, some parts of the brain become slightly more active and others, less, but the redistribution of blood flow from the less active to the more active parts explains how its overall energy cost is the same whether the brain is idling or focused.  
  
*****  
  
Now that we knew that the energy cost of primate brains was particularly high for their volume compared to nonprimate brains simply because of the larger numbers of neurons they packed into the same volume of brain tissue, I had a clear suspicion why great apes were the outliers, without larger brains to match their larger bodies: they simply couldn't afford the energy cost of both.  
  
*****  
  
The maximal body mass that a primate that foraged and fed daily for 8 hours could afford is given by making one equation equal the other to determine when energy taken in equals energy used—and that we found to happen at around 120 kilograms (265 pounds). That this body mass is not enormous but reasonably close to the typical weight of a non–alpha male silverback gorilla in the wild is highly significant: there is a limit to body mass imposed by caloric availability, and gorillas live not too far below that limit. Becoming a larger alpha male silverback requires an extra effort to find food—but, then again, one of the perks of being an alpha gorilla is getting food from the dominated peers, so in the end, it pays off to become large.  
  
*****  
  
bipedality potentially increases the amount of calories that can be amassed in a day by extending the range of food picking, for it is much easier and costs four times fewer kilocalories to walk on two feet, as humans do, than on all fours, as modern great apes do and as the ancestor from which australopithecines originated must have done.  
  
*****  
  
we pursued the hypothesis that the caloric intake from a raw food diet was so limiting that it curtailed any further increases in brain size in great apes—and ended up providing the numbers that showed, in black on white, that the availability of calories from the typical raw diet of primates is so limiting that, absent a way to overcome that limitation, the evolution of modern humans would simply not have been possible.9 There was no way for the human brain to have emerged if not for a radical change in caloric intake. And the invention of cooking provided just that.  
  
*****  
  
Even as cooking increases the caloric yield of foodstuffs, it decreases the amount of time required to obtain all those calories—simply because far less chewing is required to turn cooked foods completely into mush soft enough to be readily swallowed.  
  
*****  
  
So what do we have that no other animal has and that explains our cognitive advantage? An outstandingly large number of cortical neurons, I say—even if we came to have them the primate way, without breaking any biological or evolutionary rules. * And what do we do that no other animal does and that allowed us to become humans? Forget about deceiving, reasoning, planning, counting, using language—other animals can also do those things, at least to some extent. We cook what we eat: this is the exclusively human activity, and one that allowed us to jump over the energetic wall that still curbs the evolution of all other species and put us on a different evolutionary path from all other animals.

In what I will call the “Third Technological Revolution,” agricultural humans developed the tools not just to control their environment and their crops, but also to modify them (for most of the modern edible plants are distant versions of their original selves, starting with corn but including carrots, tomatoes, and wheat; modern genetic engineering is but an accelerated version of what we humans have been doing over the last 10,000 years). Agriculture gave rise to modern civilizations and the hierarchical social structures that persist to this day. New problems led to new technologies, which led to new materials, which allowed solving old problems and creating new ones.  
  
*****  
  
the “Fourth Technological Revolution” is far more recent: the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century that modernized farming itself through the invention of human-operated machines that mechanized agricultural work.  
  
*****  
  
the “Fifth Technological Revolution,” we went beyond machines operated by humans and created automated machines that replace human work with the turn of a button.  
  
*****  
  
the “Sixth Technological Revolution”: outsourcing to machines not just our physical work, but our mental abilities, too.  
  
*****  
  
As it turns out, there is a simple explanation for how the human brain, and it alone, can be at the same time similar to others in its evolutionary constraints, and yet so different to the point of endowing us with the ability to ponder our own material and metaphysical origins. First, we are primates, and this bestows upon humans the advantage of a large number of neurons packed into a small cerebral cortex. And second, thanks to a technological innovation introduced by our ancestors, we escaped the energetic constraint that limits all other animals to the smaller number of cortical neurons that can be afforded by a raw diet in the wild.
