### Skyward
- Two.
I felt, more than saw, the blossom of the bomb’s first explosion behind. And I felt, more than heard, M-Bot’s diagnostic tool working.
“Biological component engaged,” his voice said.
One.
“Cytonic hyperdrive: online.”
An explosion of fire surrounding us.
“What?” M-Bot said. “Spin! Engage the—”
I did something with my mind.
We vanished, leaving a ship-size hole in the expanding blossom of flame and destruction.

The answer is not to put out the spark, but to learn to control it.”

### Starsight
- More specks vanished, and—tears pouring down my face—I grabbed the front of the delver’s flight suit with both hands. I felt that overpowering expansion happening again, the alignment with its perspective, which was so vast as to make individuals meaningless.
But they weren’t.
“See them,” I whispered. “Please, just see them.”
I had seen what the delver experienced. In that frantic moment with a catastrophe starting before me, I tried to show it what I’d experienced. With all my strength I towed on its consciousness.
It worked. Instead of growing to the size of a galaxy, I pulled us down so we shrank to the size of a child. Infinity went both directions. You could expand forever outward, but at the same time, the closer you looked at something, the more detail you saw.
For a moment, we were a child who played with floating globes of water. We were Mrs. Chamwit, delivering dinner to a neighbor. We were Cuna. We were the Krell on the street who had apologized for bumping me. I touched the mind of the delver and showed it those annoyances from the perspective of each individual person. I showed it that the buzzing was sometimes laughter.
This is what I see, I said to the delver. Though I had to learn how to look.
The delver stopped advancing. Its mind touched mine, and I felt emotions, images, and alien things that were neither. Things I didn’t have the senses to otherwise experience or explain. In the midst of it was an idea…a question.
They are like us?
Not words. Ideas. The term us was projected into my mind as a set of meaningful concepts I could roughly interpret.
They…, it repeated. They are alive?
Yes, I whispered. Every one of them.
The thing trembled with an emotion I understood without needing interpretation. Horror.
The delver pulled in, somehow reversing upon itself. I was ejected from that place where I’d been, as the entire thing—the enormous planet-like mass and the strange being at the center—vanished.

- Fight…
“I will fight, Gran-Gran!” I said. “But what? How? I…I’m not right for this mission. It isn’t what I trained for. I don’t know what to do!”
A hero…does not choose…her trials, Spensa…
“Gran-Gran?” I asked, trying to pinpoint the location of the words.
She steps…into the darkness, the voice said, fading. Then she faces what comes next…
