Some men, as they age, grow kinder. I am not one of those, for I have seen how the cosmere can mistreat the innocent - and that leaves me disinclined toward kindness. Some men, as they age, grow wiser. I am not one of those, for wisdom and I have always been cross-purposes, and I have yet to learn the tongue in which she speaks. Some men, as they age, grow more cynical. I, fortunately, am not one of those. If I were, the very air would warp around me, sucking in all emotions, leaving only scorn. Other men... other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. I fear I am one of those. I am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea.

The most important step a man can take. It's not the first one, is it? It's the next one. Always the next step, Dalinar.

One can believe in a story without believing it happened

Weakness can imitate strength if bound correctly just as cowardice can imitate heroism if given nowhere to flee.

Somebody has to start. Somebody has to step forward and do what is right, because it is right. If nobody starts, then others cannot follow.

Life breaks us, Teft. Then we fill the cracks with something stronger.

Fleet kept running. He couldn't win, but he kept running. And when the storm caught him, it didn't matter that he’d died, because he'd run for all he had. We all die in the end, you see. So I guess what truly matters is just how well you've run.

Journey before destination --- you bastard

A journey will have pain and failure. It is not only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The knowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us. But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fail, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination.
