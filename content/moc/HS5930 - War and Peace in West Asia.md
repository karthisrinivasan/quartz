- One: Exchange of Letters between Israeli PM (Yitzhak Rabin) and PLO Chairman (Yasser Arafat)
	- Arafat's Letter:
		- PLO recognizes Israeli right to exist in peace and security
		- PLO accepts UN Resolutions 242 and 338
		- All outstanding issues relating to permanent status resolved through negotiations
		- Renounces terrorism and other violent acts
		- Assumes responsibility to prevent violations
		- Parts of Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist will be invalidated
	- Rabin's Letter:
		- Recognizes PLO as representative of Palestinian people and agrees to commence negotiations with PLO 
	- Unequal exchange, as can be seen
	- 'Palestinian Versailles'
	- Controversial among Palestinians
	- Boyle's Memorandum to Palestinians: Do's and Don'ts by Harvard Prof. Francis Boyle
		- 'Interim': avoid at all costs
		- Insist on International Law on new territories
		- Avoid any framework agreement
	- Palestinians went against all this advice
	- Framework vs. Peace Treaty
		- Framework only sets the agenda
			- No actual negotiations
			- Stronger party can drag the process without reaching conclusions
		- Peace Treaty has negotiations first
			- Signing at the end, after agreement on issues
	- Why did Palestinians agree?
		- Israelis had pro lawyers, many drafts
		- Palestinians didn't even speak English properly
		- Basically, they got outplayed
- Two: Declaration of Principles (DoP) - the actual Accord
	- 1994 Peace Nobel shared by Rabin, Arafat and Peres
	- To establish a Palestinian Interim Self-Govt. Authority (PA), for a period not exceeding 5 years, leading to permanent settlement
	- Gave both parties window of 5 years
	- Phased withdrawal of IDF from Gaza and Jericho - first 3 months (Phase 1)
	- Idea was that the core issues would be out of this framework for 5 years and the withdrawal and power assumption would give confidence to both parties to enter into further negotiations at the end of the 5 year period
	- DoP asked both parties to not do anything about these issues for 5 years
	- Too much trust in good faith; no backup plan
	- They started disagreeing on the extent of the withdrawal 😑 Jericho and Gaza
	- Israel kept violating terms of framework agreement
	- They wanted PA just to enforce law and order; take the burden off of IDF
	- Acknowledging govt. and extent but not the state (???)
	- 6 months wasted on term with which Arafat would be referred to:
		- President (PA) vs. Chairman (Israel)
		- Compromise: Rai (guardian/protector in Arabic)
	- Phase 1 finally completed at the end of 1995
- Oslo II - September 1995
	- Israel to redeploy forces from 440 villages and 6 Palestinian towns
		- Bethlehem, Jenin, Qalqilya, Nablus, Ramallah, Tukarm
	- Strength of Palestinian forces to be increased
	- Palestinian prisoners to be released in batches
	- Municipal elections 24 days after completion of Oslo II
	- West Bank division
		- Area A: main towns (3%) under direct PA control
		- Area B: villages and smaller communities (27%) partially by PA (civil) and by Israeli authority (security)
		- Area C: rural land (70%) with Israeli settlements, infrastructure projects and military zones fully under Israel
	- No restrictions on Israeli activity in Area C => final withdrawal never happened

### Camp David II, 2000
- Oslo invoked opposition due to misinformation (thought it was a peace treaty, not a framework agreement)
- Deadlines of Oslo not met
- Right wing extremists angry; Rabin assassinated by Yigal Amir
- Netanyahu rises to PM; was opposed to Oslo right from the beginning
- Suicide bombings by Hamas strengthened opposition
- Ehud Barak beats Netanyahu by claiming to negotiate new peace deal
- Bill Clinton seizes opportunity and invited the two leaders
	- Was at end of second term, though (lame duck)
	- Not taken too seriously
- Palestinians reluctant to attend as Oslo preconditions not fulfilled
	- Premature; PA in control of only 7% of territory when Arafat arrived at David
- Generous offer by Ehud Barak
	- Ready to cede 90-95% of occupied territory
	- Take-it-or-leave-it; no negotiations
- Clinton assured that no one will be blamed if summit fails
- Clinton blames Arafat later, though

#### Permanent Issues
- Territory
	- Details of the 90-95% offer:
		- Complete withdrawal from West Bank was a precondition anyway
		- Israel pulling a switcheroo
		- Israel also wanted to keep all its dense settlements in West Bank
		- 'Land Swap': territory occupied by settlements - equal amount from somewhere else will be given
		- West Bank will be very fragmented due to this; non-contiguous
		- Network of "Israeli only" roads that connect these settlements
	- Palestinians rejected the offer
	- ![[Pasted image 20210512164259.png]]
- Jerusalem
	- Another contested issue as both claim it as their capital
	- Temple Mount - holds all religious monuments and artifacts - East Jerusalem
	- Israeli only wanted to give symbolic control, Palestinians wanted real control
	- Proposals (absurd ones):
		- PA 'custodial' vs. Israel 'residual'
		- 'Vertical sovereignty': PA all things above the ground vs. Israel all things below the ground
- Refugees Right to Return
	- Israel only allows "family reunion" as they can't acknowledge refugees
	- cf. [[HS5930 - War and Peace in West Asia#Apr 6 - Palestinian Refugee Crisis]]

### Israeli Constituency
- Israeli-Jewish identifies as Zionist
	- Moral: cannot achieve equality as minorities in non-Jewish societies
	- Political: Immigration to Palestine and creation of Israel
	- Technical: Legal structure and routine life determined by Jew/non-Jew distinction
- Even some Israelis think this is quite racist
	- 20% of population not Jewish
- Ashkenazim (from Europe; most political leaders from here) and Mizrachim (from other countries)
- Distinction only important during peace times
	- War necessary for internal cohesion in Israel
- Lots of fragmentation in political system
- Israel taken as one constituency: elections conducted on Proportional Representation basis
- Instability in Israeli govt. (last 2 years - 4 elections)
	- Smaller parties have disproportionate power
		- Arafat could not make too many compromises due to this - his govt. would have fallen apart
	- Compromises more difficult - small parties pull too many strings
- Majority of Israelis want some compromise with Palestinians
	- Kneecapped by radical small parties 

### Palestinian Constituency
- Three existential planes: West Bank + Gaza; Israel; Diaspora
- Not all are Muslims
- Armed struggle was put forth by Christian Palestinians 
- PLO factions:
	- Fatah, PFLP, DFLP, PCP etc.
- 2006 elections and fragmentation
	- Hamas became majority; Fatah lost
	- cf. West's support of dictators; alternative is Islamic fundamentalists
- Civil war between Fatah and Hamas
	- Gaza in control of Hamas
	- West Bank in control of Fatah
- Reconciliation attempts failed
- Biggest crisis for Palestinians: Who represents them?
	- Fatah? PLO? Hamas?
- Pre-eminent problem - even before they can deal with Israelis

## India's Foreign Policy
- Nehru: 
	- Cairo-centric
	- Criticized for being pro-Arab (vote bank)
- Indira Gandhi: Palestine focused
- During Cold War - ideological issues like anti-imperialism, NAM, anti-colonialism
- Kuwait crisis 1991 - turning point
	- Expansion of political and economic engagements with West Asia
	- Reduction in emphasis on Palestine cause as it was no longer sufficient
- After Cold War - economic cooperation
	- focused on Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia
- NDA more focused on building bridges with Islamic nations than other govts. (weird)
	- National interest >>rhetoric of religious solidarity
- Palestine issue:
	- Left to fend for themselves after Cold War
	- Conflict has huge impact on long-term stability of region
	- India has high stakes in this
	- Needs to be pro-PLO without being anti-Israel (??)
- Terrorism:
	- Israel crucial supplier of military tech
	- Allies, including USA, need to convince Pakistan to stop anti-Indian activities
	- Need better relations with countries that have influence over Pakistan (SA, Iran, UAE, Turkey)
		- Could be more rewarding than relations with Israel

## Water Issues
- One of the 5 high priority issues
- Water crucial to viability of Jewish state
	- Desertification in Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon
- Difficult to analyze
	- Disputed data, history, allocation and management options
- Economically substitutable:
	- Desalination, virtual water
	- Hence won't be primary issue
- Easiest to settle 
- Israel economy much stronger than Palestine

## Hazardous Waste Management
- Environmental agreements part of [[#Oslo Accords 1993]]
	- No meaningful impact
- Transboundary agreements not effective
	- Logistical ambiguities
	- Israeli security concerns
	- Territorial disputes
	- Institutional constraints within PA
- Israel expanding economy
	- More chemical, hazardous waste
	- ~100,000 tons/year
	- Yarkon river heavily polluted
	- Pollution related illnesses more common
	- Illegal dumping in Palestinian territories
- Difficult to quantify Palestine's waste
	- No proper accounting system
	- ~2,500 tons/year
	- Probably much higher
	- Could easily pollute underground mountain aquifers
- Technical collaboration insufficient 
	- Undermined by political differences
- New initiative: PRC
	- Palestinian Recycling Committee
	- Provides critical environmental services
- Third party organizations may provide solution
	- Uninfluenced by regional politics
- Preserving ecological resources create conditions more conducive for broader peace efforts
- Marketization approach not studied yet
	- Still worth an experiment
