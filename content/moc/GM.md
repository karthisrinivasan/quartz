#### The Aravan Thing
According to legend, Aravan is one of Arjuna’s sons. To ensure victory for the Pandavas, he offers to sacrifice his life. In return, he asks for three boons. He wants to die a hero’s death during battle; he wants to watch the entire battle, even after death; and he wants to experience marital bliss. The first two boons are easy to grant: he will be honourably beheaded and his severed head will oversee the war. The third boon poses complications. None of the women want to marry him and become widows the very next day.

So, Krishna takes on his female avatar of Mohini and weds Aravan, spending a night with him as his wife. The next day, Mohini mourns his death as his widow. To commemorate this legend, the hijra community gathers each year at the Kuttantavar Temple in Koovagam village in the Ulundurpet region. Members of the community take on the role of Mohini, and enter into ritualistic marriage with Aravan, the temple deity. It is common for hijras to marry their lovers during the event.
